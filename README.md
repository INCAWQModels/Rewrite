This repository contains code for a planned INCA rewrite.

The schema subfolder contains JSON schemas for model components and time series data
The code folder contains preliminary code for a model rewrite.

There is some background documentation in the Wiki. Key features of the rewrite are:
(i) The project aims (as much as possible) to only use the Python standard librairies.
(ii) The resulting code should be multi-platform (Windows, Max, Linux and maybe more)
(iii) Modular - the UI is separate from the model and data management routines
