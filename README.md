This repository contains code for a planned INCA rewrite.

The schema subfolder contains JSON schemas for model components and time series data
The code folder contains preliminary code for a model rewrite

The project aims (as much as possible) to only use the Python standard librairies.

The resulting code should be multi-platform (Windows, Max, Linux and maybe more) and
the UI is to be separate from the model and data management routines
